  I am a computer enthusiast based in the Pacific Northwest. I've always loved
  solving puzzles and building things, and I enjoy breaking problems down to
  their fundamental components to understanding how the pieces work. For me,
  the big draw to code has always been that people can start with a flimsy idea,
  then end up building something real [ or even helpful ].

  I have a background in network design and troubleshooting, and have worked
  through a lot of (personal) programming projects over the years. My go-to
  language is Python, although I've recently beefed up on client-side Javascript
  with React and Node.js on the back-end.
